# Modules 
# kisi aur ka likha hua code hum apne code me use kar sakte hain 
# modules ko is liye use me lethe hain kyun ki hum pura scratch se code likhna na pade 
# two types of modules 

# 1) Built in modules 
# python code ke saath hi hote hain built in 
# 2) External Modules 
# external modules wo hota hai jo logon ne likha hai hum unke code ko hum apne code use kar sake 
# In modules ko install kiya jaa sakta hain with the help of pip 


# A Python module is a file containing Python code that defines functions, classes, and variables, and can include runnable code. It serves as a way to organize and reuse code.

# Types of Modules
# Standard Library Modules: Built-in modules provided with Python (e.g., math, sys, os).
# Third-Party Modules: Modules developed by others and available via package managers like pip (e.g., requests, numpy).
# User-Defined Modules: Modules created by users by saving Python code in .py files (e.g., mymodule.py).

# to install pandas library in terminal we need to do 
# pip install pandas
# if we want to import pandas then we need to do 
# import pandas
# # Then if we want to print pandas 
# print("hi")
